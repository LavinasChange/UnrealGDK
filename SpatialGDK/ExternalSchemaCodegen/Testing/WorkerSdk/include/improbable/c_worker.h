   * Worker_ComponentUpdate types, for the given component ID (or by default, if this is the default
   * vtable), in order to offload serialization and deserialization work to internal SDK threads.
   *
   * For simplest usage of the SDK, all function pointers can be set to NULL, and only the
   * schema_type field should be used in each type.
   *
   * In order to support usage of the user_handle field on instances of the corresponding type when
   * used as input data to the SDK, X_serialize() must be provided.
   *
   * In order to support usage of the user_handle field on instances of the corresponding type when
   * received as output data to the SDK, X_deserialize() must be provided.
   *
   * X_free() should free resources associated with the result of calling X_deserialize() or
   * X_copy() (if provided).
   *
   * This decision can be made on a per-component, per-handle-type, and per-direction (input or
   * output) basis. In the case of providing data to the SDK, the asynchronous serialization flow
   * can be disabled even on a per-call basis by providing a non-NULL schema_type pointer instead of
   * a user_handle pointer. The concrete types pointer to by the user_handle fields may different
   * between components or between handle types.
   *
   * All of the functions below, if provided, will be called from arbitary internal SDK threads, and
   * therefore must be thread-safe. A single user_handle pointer will not be passed to multiple
   * callbacks concurrently, but a user_handle may be copied twice and the _results_ of those copies
   * may be used concurrently.
   *
   * For a concrete example, consider calling Worker_Connection_SendComponentUpdate() with
   * short-circuiting enabled. The SDK will call component_update_copy() twice on the provided
   * user_handle. One copy will be used for the outgoing flow, and will be serialized with
   * component_update_serialize() and subsequently freed with component_update_free(). Concurrently,
   * the other copy will be passed back to the user as part of a Worker_OpList and freed with
   * component_update_free() when the OpList is deallocated (or, if its lifetime is extended with
   * Worker_AcquireComponentUpdate(), when the last reference is released by the user with
   * Worker_ReleaseComponentUpdate()).
   *
   * In general, the two most obvious strategies are:
   * 1) reference-counting. Have X_copy() (atomically) increase a reference count and return the
   *    same pointer it was given, have X_free() (atomically) decrease the reference count and
   *    deallocate if zero. X_deserialize() should allocate a new object with reference count of 1,
   *    set the reference count of any new handle passed into the SDK to 1 initially and call
   *    X_free() manually afterwards. In this case, data owned by the user_handle should never be
   *    mutated after its first use. (This is the approach used internally for the schema_type.)
   * 2) deep-copying. Have X_copy() allocate an entirely new deep copy of the object, and X_free()
   *    deallocate directly. In this case, user_handles can be mutated freely. */

/* The four handle types below behave similarly. They support both direct use of schema data types,
 * and alternatively conversion between schema types and custom user-defined handle types on worker
 * threads.
 *
 * When passing an object into the API, either:
 * - assign a new object created via the schema API (e.g. Schema_CreateComponentUpdate()) to the
 *   schema_type field. In this case, the API takes ownership of the schema object.
 * - leave the schema_type field NULL, and provide a custom pointer in the user_handle field. In
 *   this case, the corresponding vtable for the component must supply copy, free and serialize
 *   functions. The API will call X_copy() zero or more times, call X_serialize() if necessary to
 *   convert to a new schema object, and call X_free() on each copy.
 * In both cases, the user does not need to explicitly deallocate schema object (e.g. with
 * Schema_DestroyCompnentUpdate()).
 *
 * When the API passes an object to the user, either:
 * - if no deserialize() function is provided in the corresponding vtable for the component, only
 *   the schema_type field will be non-NULL. The API owns this object, and it will usually be
 *   deallocated when the user-supplied callback returns. To extend the lifetime of the data, call
 *   the relevant Worker_AcquireX() function (e.g. Worker_AcquireComponentUpdate()) and use the
 *   resulting pointer. This must then be explicitly deallocated by calling the corresponding
 *   Worker_ReleaseX() function (e.g. Worker_ReleaseComponentUpdate()) to avoid memory leaks.
 * - if an X_deserialize() function is provided, in which case a X_free() function should also be
 *   provided, both the schema_type and user_handle fields will be non-NULL, the latter filled with
 *   the result of calling the X_deserialize() function. Again, the API owns these objects and will
 *   usually deallocate them. The relevant Worker_AcquireX() function works as before, and will
 *   extend the lifetime of both the schema_type and the user_handle (by calling the user-provided
 *   X_copy() function in the latter case). If only the user_handle needs to be preserved, this is
 *   possible by manually calling the user-provided copy() and free() functions (or otherwise, since
 *   the semantics of the user_handles is up to the user).
 *
 * Note that objects pointed-to by the schema_type fields must _not_ be mutated by the user when
 * owned by the SDK (either because they have been passed as input data to the SDK, or because they
 * were passed out of the SDK to user code), as the SDK may be using them internal concurrently.
 *
 * Similarly, the user must ensure any use of a SDK-owned user_handle is safe with respect to the
 * SDK passing other copies of the handle to the vtable concurrently.
 *
 * Since the schema_type is deallocated when the last copy of a user_handle is freed, it is
 * generally safe for a user_handle produced by X_deserialize() to depend on data owned by the
 * schema_type, and for a schema_type produced by X_serialize() to depend on data owned by the
 * user_handle. */
